# Java Labyrinth Project

Educational project designed to help students learn Java programming concepts through examples and small challenges.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand basic Java syntax and structure
- Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts
- Learn how to use enums, classes, and interfaces
- Work with loops, arrays, and collections
- Understand how to handle user input and simple logic
